# The Story Behind Hangman

I created Hangman during the fall of 2020 for my second web development class.

I used the experience I gained when making [Word Guessing Game](https://github.com/ZoltanKuli/Word-Guessing-Game), but I tried to make this project better.

I decided to use Bootstrap so that it would be easier to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, and I also tried to go for a calming look that was pleasant on the eyes.

It was still not the most complex or challenging of my projects, but recreating another classic game was definitely a fun experience.
